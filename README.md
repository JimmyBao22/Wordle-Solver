# Wordle-Solver

Program that attempts to solve Wordles. Note: the wordles being solved here are 7 letters (and therefore 7 guess attempts instead of 6).

The goal is to minimize the number of average guesses used, as well as the time it takes for a round to complete.

With the above program, the average number of guesses is around 3.6.
